# Project 4 Reflection
Project 4 Reflection

The completion of this project has been incredibly satisfying. We all worked really hard throughout each stage of app creation, and ulimately we created an effective but also easy to use application. Furthermore I feel we did well in both the oral and written communication part, we all contributed evenly and effectively. As a result our presentation was good and our written submission was good. Throughout completing this project I have felt I could rely on my teammates and we all contributed fairly.

Now I need to shift focus to the final test which is in 6 days.
